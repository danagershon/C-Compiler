# C-Compiler
Theory of Compilation Course: Implementing a full compiler for a C-like programming language.

Includes all stages of the compiler:

• Lexical Analyzer with Flex: recognizing tokens such as keywords, identifiers, and values

• Bottom-up parser with Bison: recognizing statements and control flow structures

• Semantic Analyzer: checking semantic correctness of statements like valid use of variables

• LLVM Intermediate Code Generation: translating C code into LLVM Intermediate Representation code
