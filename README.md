# Compiler LLVM Code Generator
Theory of Compilation Course HW5: LLVM Intermediate Code Generation

• Translate C code into LLVM Intermediate Representation code using Backpatching for control flow structures

• The LLVM Intermediate Representation code is then converted to machine code by LLVM

• This repo contains the source files of all the previous compiler stages, to form the complete compiler
